Creating a cross-platform is a simple way to reach an audience of different platforms without learning multiple technologies. Creating native android or ios apps is not that difficult. Still, as you may already be aware, Android uses JVM-based technologies such as Kotlin, Java, etc., whereas iOS uses Swift programming language to develop apps. Maintaining two different apps in two different technological domains may give its own set of headaches, not the least learning two multiple programming languages, toolsets, and build methodologies. This is where cross-platform application development frameworks like react native help a great deal.

# React Native
React Native is a cross-platform mobile application development framework developed by Facebook. It can be used to create applications for Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, and few others without maintaining different code bases. The name React Native should give an indication as to what you may expect when developing apps using it. If you are familiar with ReactJS, you will feel right at home in using React Native.

However, you cannot use pure HTML tags such as `<div>` or `<img>`; instead, you will have to use `<View>` and <Image> for doing that. You can't use native CSS styling; However, ReactNative created a styling mechanism that looks identical to CSS with minor changes. We will discuss those as we go forward.

## Challenges
Even though creating multiple apps using react native is easy creation of new projects is not quite.
