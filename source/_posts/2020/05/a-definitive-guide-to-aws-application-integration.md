Last year has been a roller coaster ride for me. Adjusting to the new team, new technologies, new country, moving across continents and many more stressful scenarios. However something good came of 2019 by end of it. We have published our book, The Definitive Guide to AWS Application Integration. You can buy it from amazon any many more stores.
